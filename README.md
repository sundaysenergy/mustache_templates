mustache_templates
==================

The place to put your mustache template for use with the cape easy compile feature.

The idea is to apply a source data feed against the template.

This is the template repository for templates we create. How do we import from other users? A static site on dropbox or github...

Your templates are accessible via http://templates.cape.io
